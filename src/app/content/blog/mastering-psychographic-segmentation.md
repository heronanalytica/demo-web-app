## TL;DR:
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;     
This guide explains **psychographic and demographic segmentation – building a customer persona consisting of demographics, consumer attitudes, values, lifestyles, and personality traits** – and elaborates on how the psychographic persona helps businesses predict behavior, personalize communication, and align marketing strategies with customer motivations.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Key Steps:
1. **Define Research Objectives**: Identify relevant personality traits for business impact.  
2. **Survey Design**: Combine demographic questions and personality frameworks such as Big Five, MBTI, Enneagram.  
3. **Boost Response Rate**: Incentives, optimize timing, mobile friendliness.  
4. **Cluster & Visualize respondents**: Apply hierarchical clustering to identify customer segments.  
5. **Create Personas From Clustering**: Use analytics output to build personas.  
6. **Apply Personas To Marketing Strategy**: How to use personas to target customers with tailored messaging & campaigns.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
## Introduction:

&nbsp;  
Basic market research and segmentation – focusing on demographics like age, gender, and location – is a good starting point for understanding consumer groups. However, it's important to go beyond these basic attributes and delve into the deeper motivations and psychological drivers that really influence customer decisions and behaviors.

By building customer personas based on demographics and psychographics, you gain insights into the "why" behind consumer behavior. This allows you to:
- **Predict behavior**: Understand how personality traits (e.g., openness, conscientiousness) shape preferences.
- **Personalize communication**: Tailor messaging to resonate with innate motivations, values, and beliefs that drive behaviors.

In short, advanced psychographic analysis goes beyond the surface-level “what” factors to the deeper “why” factors. With this approach, you can uncover meaningful patterns in consumer psychology, leading to more precise, relevant, and engaging strategies in product development, marketing, and beyond.  
This guide helps you to build the advanced persona.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## Step 1: Define Research Objectives

&nbsp;  
Align research objectives with business objectives. Examples:
- *“We’ll be launching new products and which customer we market to?”*

Key Questions:
- Which customers are more open to try new products?  
- Do I use traditional marketing channels or digital channels for the customer segment?  
- What are their values and beliefs?


&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## Step 2: Design Your Survey

&nbsp;  
To create comprehensive personas, a combination of psychographic and demographic questionnaire is essential. In the survey, we use validated scales whenever feasible (e.g., Likert scales for attitudes, values inventories, etc.).

&nbsp;  
### 2.1 Researched Personality Frameworks
Numerous personality frameworks are available and 3 are listed below. In the survey example, we used the Big Five framework because it is a widely recognized one. However, you can select other frameworks that align with your research objectives.

&nbsp;  
- **Big Five (OCEAN)**: Measures Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Ideal for broad behavioral insights.
- **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)**: Categorizes 16 personality types (e.g., INTP, ESFJ). Useful for team dynamics and communication styles.  
- **Enneagram**: Identifies 9 interconnected personality types (e.g., The Reformer, The Helper). Focuses on core fears and motivations.


&nbsp;  

### 2.2 Example Survey Questions
Below is a sample survey designed to illustrate the practical application of various question types (demographic, and psychographics) in research. You can customize the survey to align with your specific research objectives.
#### **Demographic question**:
- *“What is your current age?”*  
- *“What is your current occupation?”*  

#### **Psychographic question**:
To gather insights into attitude, values, lifestyle, and personality traits, we recommend using a likert scale. It allows us to run advanced analytics on the data using Python. There are various versions of the likert scale, such as 3/5/7/10 point scales. For our sample survey, we’ve chosen a 5-point scale because it strikes a balance between simplicity and offering a good range of options for respondents. Feel free to explore other variations of the likert scale if you prefer. We suggest using the same scale across multiple surveys to make it easier for you to compare results.  
&nbsp;  
5-point likert scale:   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 = Strongly Disagree,    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 = Disagree    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 = Neither Disagree or Agree  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 = Agree   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 = Strongly Agree     

&nbsp;  
**Attitudes & Values**  
- *“I make decisions with the greater good in mind.”*  
- *“Traditional values are important to me.”*  
- *“I believe companies should actively engage in social or environmental issues.”*  

**Lifestyle**  
- *“How many hours per week do you spend on social media?”*  
- *“How often do you try out new products or services?”*  

**Personality Traits (Big Five)** (select 1 question. If you want to include 2 or more questions, you need to average scores prior to analytics) 
- Openness to Openness to Experience: 
  - *“I enjoy exploring abstract ideas.”*  
  - *“I seek out new foods, cultures, or travel experiences.”*  
  - *“I prefer routine over spontaneity.”* (Reverse-scored)”
- Conscientiousness: 
  - *“I always meet deadlines and keep promises.”*  
  - *“My workspace is organized and clutter-free.”*  
  - *“I procrastinate often.”* (Reverse-scored)  
- Extraversion:
  - *“I feel energized after social events.”*  
  - *“I prefer quiet evenings at home over parties.”* (Reverse-scored) 
  - *“I enjoy being the center of attention.”*  
- *Agreeableness*:
  - *“I prioritize others’ needs over my own.”*  
  - *“I avoid confrontations whenever possible.”* 
  - *“I trust people until they give me a reason not to.”*  
- *Neuroticism*:
  - *“I worry about small mistakes at work or home.”*  
  - *“I feel overwhelmed by stress.”*
  - *“I remain calm in unpredictable situations.”*  (Reverse-scored)


&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## Step 3: Boost Response Rate

&nbsp;  
**Why Boosting Response Rates Matters:**  
Collecting a lot of responses is crucial for advanced analytics. It makes your results more accurate and reliable, because you have more data to work with. It also helps you avoid making mistakes when you’re grouping people, so your segmentation is more precise. Plus, the more responses you get, the better your insights will be when you’re clustering or developing personas. This means you’ll be more confident in your findings and be able to make better decisions.  
&nbsp;  
**How to boost response rate:**  
- **Incentives**: A prize draw of gift cards worth $100+.  
- **Timing**: Send surveys on weekdays between 10 AM–2 PM for higher open rate. However, please note that this doesn’t apply to everyone. Before launching your survey, take some time to research your customers and find the best time to reach them.  
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure surveys are smartphone friendly.

## Step 4: Hierarchical Clustering & Visualization

&nbsp;  
### 4.1 Matching Question to Column
In this table, you can see how each question from Step 2.2 is mapped to a specific column - enabling organized data analysis in python.   
&nbsp;

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### 4.2 Sample Collected Responses
Below is the sample dataset of 28 respondents, showing the values for each psychographic attribute. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### 4.3 Python Code
To run advanced analytics and create personas, we’ll need Python. If you haven’t installed Python yet, you can follow these instructions. There are several clustering models to choose from, and in the code we’ve prepared for you, we used hierarchical clustering because our dataset is small and we don’t need to decide on the number of clusters upfront. K-mean is also a popular choice because it’s simple and fast, but you need to pre-specify the number of clusters. K-mean is also better suited for larger datasets.

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

## Step 5: Create Personas from Dendrogram with High/Low Attribute Scores
&nbsp;  
Based on the output, let’s say we want to create 2 segments or personas from the chart. If you want to add more personas, simply lower Euclidean Distance. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;  
Here’s how to interpret each segment’s high and low average scores - and what each attribute means for that persona’s psychology and behavior.  
&nbsp;  

### Persona 1: Structured Realists

&nbsp;  

## Step 6: Apply personas to Marketing Strategies  
&nbsp;  

In step 1, the marketing objective is to find customers who are open to trying new products. Persona 2 would be a great fit for this since they’re more open to new ideas. Here’s a sample campaign for the “Innovative Pioneer” This shows how you can use their traits -high social media activity, love of new products, and social responsibility focus - to marketing ideas.

**Campaign Theme: “Be Part of the Change”**   
- **Objective:** Launch a new eco-friendly product line that supports a social cause, appealing directly to their Att_GreaterGood and Att_SocialIssues scores.  

**Digital Activation & Influencer Partnerships**   
- **Influencer Selection:** Collaborate with micro-influencers or social activists who advocate for sustainability.  
- **Social Channels:** Primarily Instagram and TikTok, leveraging dynamic short-form video content.   

**Early Access & “Viral” Exclusives**
- **Beta Testing:** Allow Persona 2 members to sign up early for a “limited-run” version of your product.  
- **Referral Incentives:** Offer them bonus perks (discount codes, gift products) for each friend they refer.   
- **Online Launch Events:** Host virtual product demos with behind-the-scenes footage, highlighting how the product aligns with social/environmental causes.  

**Key Messaging & Visuals**
- **Emphasize Impact:** “Support communities in need,” “Every purchase plants a tree,” or “10% of proceeds go to ocean cleanup.”
- **Vibrant, Forward-Looking Imagery:** Videos, infographics, and user stories that exude energy, creativity, and optimism.
